        <strong>Purple</strong> is a rudimentary, text‑based mini‑game distributed in 1986 as a
        free promotional floppy disk by <strong>K.O.M‑Games</strong>. The project served as an early demo
        and proof‑of‑concept for a planned full‑scale arcade title of the same name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The demo features a minimal rule set: the player, represented by a purple <strong>♣</strong> symbol,
        must collect keys and reach an exit door while avoiding fast‑moving enemies.

      <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
      <div class="game-symbols">
        Player: ♣ (purple)<br />
        Keys: ♀ (yellow)<br />
        Exit Door: █ (gray)<br />

      <p>
        ANSI color codes were used to enhance the visual presentation — an uncommon and experimental
        technique at the time — reinforcing the game’s distinctive “Purple” identity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Background and Controversy</h2>
      <p>
		The mini-game was distributed during the planned opening of a new arcade venue. The floppy disks
		were limited to approximately 300 copies and were intended to generate interest in the upcoming
		arcade release Purple.
      </p>
      <p>
		Only a few days after distribution — and prior to the arcade game’s official release — the venue was forced
		to close. This followed a series of user complaints claiming that the floppy disk contained computer viruses.
      </p>
      <p>
		The exact nature of these reports was never conclusively determined. It remains unclear whether the issues
		were caused by actual malware, false positives triggered by unusual file structures, or incompatibilities with
		early virus detection software.
      </p>
      <p>
		Regardless of the cause, the incident marked the abrupt end of K.O.M-Games’ first public release attempt.

      <h2>Technical Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Despite its failure, <em>Purple (1986)</em> formed the technical foundation for later internal
        K.O.M‑Games projects. Subsequent builds are known to have reused significant portions of its
        codebase, including early save and load system logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, “Purple” (1986) is considered a rare and historically significant artifact within the early
		development history of K.O.M-Games.
